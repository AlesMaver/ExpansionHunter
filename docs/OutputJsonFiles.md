# JSON files

JSON files generated by Expansion Hunter contain an array with entries describing each genotyped repeat. Each entry
contains the following fields.

 Field                       | Description
-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 RepeatId                    | Unique string identifier of the repeat region
 ReferenceLocus              | 1-based reference coordinates of the repeat region (`chrom:start-end`)
 RepeatUnit                  | Repeat unit in the reference orientation
 Genotype                    | Repeat genotype given by the size of each repeat allele
 GenotypeConfidenceInterval  | Size confidence interval for each repeat allele
 GenotypeSupport             | Counts of spanning, flanking, and in-repeat reads (in this order) consistent with each repeat allele
 CountsOfSpanningReads       | Summary of identified spanning reads given as a list with entries (`read count`, `number of repeat units spanned`)
 CountsOfFlankingReads       | Summary of identified flanking reads
 CountsOfAnchoredRepeatReads | Summary of identified anchored repeat reads
 CountsOfInrepeatReadPairs   | Summary of identified in-repeat read pairs
